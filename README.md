# Multipledescent
This is the supplementary material for the article "Multiple descent in the multiple random feature model". The online supplementary (onlinesupplementary.pdf) is only for getting deeper understandings of our technical proofs in the submitted paper.


The code of theoretical curves for multiple random feature models are given in the three folders: 2activations, 3activations and 4activations. Readers may use activation.R and parameterpart.R to initialize the hyper parameters, and use the function in SolveStieljesequations.R to get the fixed point. Theoretical curves are calculated in the Theorycurve.R.


The code of experimental points for multiple random feature models are given in multidescent.ipynb: The code is given for the four different activation functions, but readers could use it to reformulate the 2activation functions or 3activation functions.
