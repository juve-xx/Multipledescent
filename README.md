# Multipledescent
This is the supplementary material for the article "Multiple descent in the multiple random feature model". The online supplementary is only for getting deeper understandings of our technical proofs in the submitted paper.


The code of theoretical curves for Multiple random features are given in the three folders: 2activations, 3activations and 4activations. Readers may use activation.R and parameter part to initialize the hyper parameters, and use the function in SolveStieljesequations.R to get the fixed point. Theoretical curves are calculated in the Theorycurve.R.
